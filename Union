<h1>
	Union Carried By Uhre Hatrick In 4-2 Win Over Toronto
</h1>

<p>
	The Union started the match off by taking 4-0 lead until the 66 minute mark when Toronto was able to score their first goal of the match. It remained 4-1 until the 91 minute mark when Toronto was able to score again. The Union has struggle to start fast in their past few matches, so setting the tone early is important to this team.

<h2>
	Union Striker Julian Carranza Improving Down The Stretch
</h2>

<p>
	In a somewhat off start to the season, only recording 3 goals and 0 assists in 7 matches Carranza has been showing promise and began returning to last seasons form. Over their last 2 games Carranza has scored multiple crucial goals allowing them to advance in the Concacaf Champions League.
