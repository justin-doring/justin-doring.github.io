<h1>
	Could Bryce Harper Be The Phillies Answer For 1B?
</h1>

<p>
    Harper, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery, was seen taking reps at 1B at a team practice. With Rhys Hoskins and Darick Hall likely to miss extended time, the Phillies are in a pinch when it comes to 1B. Harper could fill in at 1B because it doesn't require too much arm strength and be added back into the batting line up as early as late-May. With this sounding like a good move, adding more of a workload to the teams MVP and increasing his potential to be injured as he comes back from an injury doesn't seem like such a good idea.

	Darick Hall Suffers Torn UCL
</h2>

<p>
	Phillies 1B replacement for Rhys Hoskins, who tore his ACL weeks earlier, has torn his UCL in his right thumb and is expected to miss a few months of the season. The Phillies are calling up Kody Clemens in respose. Alec Bohm will likely rotate to 1B from 3B, Clemens is expected to rotate wherever Bohm isn't playing.
